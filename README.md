# Support-Vector-Machine
• Implementation of Support vector machine on famous Iris and Digits datasets of Scikit-learn module.

• Trained the SVM model using gradient descent method to minimise regularised hinge loss function.

• Visualised the datasets w.r.t features and calculated evaluation metrics and plotted confusion matrix.
